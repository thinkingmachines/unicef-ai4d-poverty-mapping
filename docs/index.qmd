The UNICEF AI4D Poverty Mapping Project aims to develop open datasets and machine learning (ML) models  for poverty mapping estimation across nine countries in Southeast Asia (SEA).

We also aim to open source all the scripts, experiments and other artifacts used for 
developing these datasets and models, in order to allow others to replicate our work,
as well as to collaborate and extend our work for their own use cases.

This project is part of [Thinking Machines's overall push for open science through the AI4D
(AI for Development) Research Bank](https://stories.thinkingmachin.es/unicef-ai4d-research-bank/) 
which aims to accelerate the development and adoption of effective machine learning (ML) models for 
development across Southeast Asia.

* The notebooks and code for the project are all available at our [Github repository](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/unicef-ai4d-poverty-mapping)
